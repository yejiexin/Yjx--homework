1.  Bubble Sort the list: 33, 56, 17, 8, 95, 22. Make sure the final result is from small to large. Write out the list after the 2nd pass.

1）33 56 17 8 95 22

2) 33 17 8 56 22 95

3) 17 8 33 22 56 95

4) 8 17 22 33 56 95

5) 8 17 22 33 56 95

6) 8 17 22 33 56 95

So the result is "8 17 22 33 56 95"

```
FOR the number i it read is smaller than the sum of the array reduce one 
    FOR the number j it read is smaller than the sum of the array reduce (i + 1)
        IF the jth number is smaller teh (j + 1)number 
            change the position of the two number
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
ENDFOR
```

2. Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. Design an algorithm to insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with value 50,67,99. 思考： 为什么选择插入点在list头上、 中间、 尾巴上的三个数作为算法测试的数据,你能解释吗?

```
for(i = 0; i < 6; ++ i) {
    if(a[i] < x < a[i + 1]) {
        链表 a[i] < x < a[i + 1]
    }
    else if(x < a[0]) {
        链表 x < a[0]
    }
    else {
        链表 x > a[5]
    }
}

```

因为恰好对应链表的三种情况。

3. What is the state of the stack after the following sequence of Push and Pop operations? Push “anne”; Push “get”; Push “your” ; Pop; Push “my” Push “gun”

When push “anne” and push “get”,  “anne” and “get” are store in the stacks in order, then we input the instruction "Pop",so the stacts is empty and it output "get" and "anne" in order; then we continue push "your", stack is filled with a data again, then we call "Pop", the stack is empty again and it output "your";finally, we push "my" and "gun" in order, so the first stack is filled with "my" and the second one is filled with "gun".
