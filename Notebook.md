#Chapter 01    Introduction
1.	The difference between hardware and software?
**Hardware**
The physical elements of a computing system (printer, circuit boards, wires, keyboard…) 
**Software** 
The programs that provide the instructions for a computer to execute.
2. Layer of Computing System

3. **Abstraction(抽象)**
A mental model that removes complex details.
This is a key concept. Abstraction will reappear throughout the text.
4. Early History of Computing
**Abacus(算盘)**
An early device to record numeric values.
**Blaise Pascal**
Mechanical device to add, subtract, divide & multiply.
**Joseph Jacquard**
Jacquard’s Loom, the punched card(穿孔卡片).
**Charles Babbage**
Analytical Engine.
**Ada Lovelace**
First Programmer,the loop.
**Alan Turing**
Turing Machine, Artificial Intelligence Testing.
**Harvard Mark I,ENIAC,UIVAC I**
Early computers launch new era in mathematics, physics, engineering and economics
5. First Generation Hardwave(1951-1959)
**Vacuum Tubes(真空管)**
Large, not very reliable, generated a lot of heat.
**Magnetic Drum(磁鼓)**
Memory device that rotated under a read/write head.(在读写头下旋转的存储设备)
**Card Readers(读卡器) -> Magnetic Tape Drives（磁带驱动器）**
Sequential auxiliary storage devices.(序贯辅助存储设备)
6. Second Generation Hardwave(1959-1965)
**Transistor(晶体管)**
Replaced vacuum tube, fast, small, durable（耐用）, cheap.
**Magnetic Cores(磁芯)**
Replaced magnetic drums, information available ==instantly==.
**Magnetic Disks(磁盘)**
Replaced magnetic tape, data can be accessed directly（直接访问）.
7. Third Generation Hardwave(1965-1971)
**Integrate Circuits(集成电路)**
Replaced circuit boards, smaller, cheaper, faster, more
reliable. 
**Transistors**
Now used for memory construction(存储器结构).
**Terminal（终点站）**
An input/output device with a keyboard and screen.
8. Fourth Generation Hardwave(1971-?)
**Large-scale Integration**
Great advances in chip(芯片) technology.
**PCs, the Commercial Market(商业市场), Workstations**
Personal Computers were developed as new companies like Apple and Atari came into being. Workstations emerged（出现）.
9. **Moore's Law**
The number of transistors incorporated in a chip will approximately double every 24 months.
(芯片中的晶体管数量每24个月大约增加一倍。)
10. Parallel Computing and Networking(并行计算与网络化)
**Parallel Computing**
Computers rely on interconnected central processing units that increasse processing speed.
(计算机依赖于互连的中央处理单元，从而提高处理速度。)
**Network**
With the Ethernet small computers could be connected and share resources. A file serve connected PCs in the late 1980s.
**ARRANET and LANs -> Internet(阿帕网 与 局域网 -> 互联网)**
11. First Generation Sofewave(1951-1959)
